# WhatsApp AI Agent Overview
# 
# The WhatsApp AI agent is a chatbot integrated with Twilio's WhatsApp API, designed to automate responses
# to incoming messages from users. Powered by AI, it can be customized to respond to various queries based 
# on pre-defined logic or machine learning models. The chatbot can be used for customer support, providing
# product information, handling FAQs, or simply interacting with users in a conversational manner.
# 
# Key Features:
# - Instant responses to user queries via WhatsApp.
# - Customizable conversation flow based on user input.
# - Integration with Twilio for WhatsApp messaging.
# - Scalable and can be expanded with more complex AI models.
#
# Use Cases:
# - Customer support automation.
# - Interactive user engagement for businesses.
# - Information retrieval for users.


# 1. Create a Twilio Account
#    Go to Twilio's website.
#    Sign up and verify your account.
#    Get a Twilio phone number with WhatsApp capabilities. 

# 2. Set Up Python Environment
#    Create a virtual environment:

# 3. Get Twilio Credentials
#    After logging into Twilio, get your Account SID, Auth Token, and WhatsApp-enabled phone number
#    from the Twilio console.

# 4. Build the Flask Application

# 5. Connect Twilio with Flask
#    Twilio needs a publicly accessible URL to send messages to your Flask app. Use a tool like ngrok to expose 
#    your local server to the internet:
#    Take note of the ngrok URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io).

# 6. Configure Twilio Webhook
#    Go to your Twilio Console -> Messaging -> WhatsApp.
#    Set the Webhook URL to your ngrok URL followed by /whatsapp (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io/whatsapp).

# 7. Test Your Chatbot
#    Send a WhatsApp message to your Twilio number (which you set up during the account creation).
#    You should receive responses based on the logic defined in the Flask app.
